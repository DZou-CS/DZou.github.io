            <p>I am aspiring software developer and also the Vice President of the Long Island University Computer Science Club, I will be graduating with my bachelor’s degree in May 2017.
             My field of interest is in computer vision and object detection; I’ve been studying and using OpenCV for my mini projects. 
            I also assemble computers on the side, I’ve worked in a small computer repair shop when I was 16 years old.
             It was at the repair shop where I found my interest in computers. I started assembling my own custom PC and custom PCs for friends after some convincing. </p>
            <br />
            <p>I got into programming thanks in large part to Blizzard’s Warcraft 3 Map Editor, it was a built-in game engine of sort that allowed players to use the
             game’s assets in conjunction with the editor’s custom scripting language (JASS Script) to create mini games called custom maps.
             I would sit days on end creating custom maps on my Hewlett-Packard Pentium 3 computer.
             I made the units and heroes in that game perform actions and make small cinematic events and I did not fathom the ability or the idea that it was possible to program other things.
             I thought that Blizzard’s master piece was the only thing that can do this kind of stuff in -- not to say there were not bugs and glitches that came with their editor, nontheless, I spent many a summers on creating these custom maps to play with friends.</p>

            <h2 style="padding:20px 0px;"> Why Computer Vision?</h2>
            <p>In my CS 101 class, we were taught python as an introduction into programming; while I was not particularly new to programming I spent most of my time researching the kinds of things that python was capable of. After some digging around,
             I discovered the python image library (PIL) which is capable of processing images
             and then I started getting all these ideas of being able to identify objects but little did I know that PIL was incapable of it or rather it was not the right library.
             It wasn’t until much later that I discovered OpenCV which met the requirements, since then I started studying it and building simple programs using OpenCV.
             My end Goal is to create a program that can detect and tag the various objects in any given image. And I think that what 
            I am doing is a step in the right direction given what the current trend in technology is.</p>
            <p>And why do I think computer vision is going to be a big deal? Computer vision is only going to get bigger as time goes on; artificial intelligence and machine learning has been growing ever so fast, it’s being used in by many industries and has it endless applications.
             While computer vision is just one of the many aspects in which a device can interact and understand our physical world, it will be the most, if not one of the most, effective ways. As things are becoming more autonomous,
             there is no doubt in my mind that there will be a reliance on computer vision to forge our way to full autonomy. </p>
